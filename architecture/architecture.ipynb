    "# Open-Notebook (LLM) - Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Purpose & Scope\n",
    "**Goal:** Provide a clear, high-level architecture overview of the Open-Notebook system so that any developer or stakeholder can understand how the major components fit together.\n",
    "**Scope:** This document covers the primary runtime architecture: frontend, backend, worker processes, database, external AI providers, and storage, but excludes deployment infrastructure details (for example containers, cloud infra, CI/CD).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Architecture Approach\n",
    "We use a container-style documentation approach (inspired by the C4 model) to show:\n",
    "- system context (how external actors interact)\n",
    "- internal containers and how they communicate\n",
    "- dependencies on external services\n",

    "**Containers and Responsibilities**\n",
    "- Frontend (Next.js UI): user-facing web application that handles rendering, navigation, uploads, and proxies API calls.\n",
    "- API Backend (FastAPI): handles HTTP API requests such as CRUD, search, chat, and orchestrates background tasks.\n",
    "- Worker (background processing): asynchronous tasks for processing uploads, chunking text, embedding, and rebuilding embeddings.\n",
    "- Model Manager (ModelMgr): selects, loads, and manages embedding or LLM models and interacts with external AI providers.\n",
    "- Database (SurrealDB): stores persistent data (metadata, embeddings, model info) and runs vector or text searches.\n",
    "- External AI Providers: third-party embedding or LLM services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.).\n",
    "- Storage Volumes or File Storage: keeps raw uploads and durable database or user data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Data and Process Flows\n",
    "1. User uploads a source or file -> Frontend handles upload -> Backend API stores metadata in DB and saves file to storage.\n",
    "2. Backend triggers Worker for ingestion -> Worker parses and chunks -> Worker requests embeddings via Model Manager -> embeddings return -> Worker writes embeddings and processed content to DB.\n",
    "3. User search/chat request -> Frontend -> Backend API -> DB vector_search or text_search -> results return to Frontend.\n",
    "4. Model Manager reads default model metadata from DB, instantiates embedding or LLM models using AI providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Why This Architecture\n",
    "- Clear separation of concerns (UI, API, background processing, storage, model management) improves maintainability and scalability.\n",
    "- Asynchronous worker keeps API responsive while heavy embedding or processing runs in the background.\n",
    "- External AI providers keep the system modular and allow swapping providers as needed.\n",
    "- Persistent database plus file storage protects user data, embeddings, and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. How to Use or Maintain This Document\n",
    "- Keep this document alongside the codebase (for example docs/architecture.md).\n",
    "- Update the diagram and explanation whenever system boundaries or flows change.\n",
    "- Store PlantUML source in version control so anyone can regenerate visual assets.\n",
    "- Reference this doc during onboarding or reviews to understand system interactions.\n"
